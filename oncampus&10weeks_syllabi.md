# On-Campus Course Syllabi

### Course Description
These courses are semester-long project-based explorations into iOS, Android or Cybersecurity of intense, project-focused training inspired by our professional courses and facilitated by CodePath-trained Teaching Assistants. Classes meet on campus once or twice a week for lab and working sessions. In the first half of the course, students develop skills by completing coding labs and building fully functional app assignment projects. In the second half of the course students will apply their skills--working together in small teams--to design and build an original app from the ground up. The course culminates in a Demo Day event where teams will present their finished apps in a live demo.

### Time Commitment

- **Live session attendance:** Classes meet once or twice per week for 1-2 hour sessions over the duration of the semester.
  - **NOTE:** Session frequency and duration may vary depending on college.
- **Outside of class time:** Students should plan to spend 5-10 hours outside of class working on weekly assignments and their final group project.
