### Course Description

This course is a semester-long project-based exploration into iOS mobile app development focusing on the design and implementation of RESTful API clients. Classes meet on campus twice a week for lab and working sessions. In the first half of the course, students develop skills by completing coding labs and building three fully functional app assignment projects. In the second half of the course students will apply their skills--working together in small teams--to design and and build an original app from the ground up. The course culminates in a Demo Day event where teams will present their finished apps in a live demo.

### Prerequisites and eligibility

Students should...

- have sufficient access to a Mac computer in order to complete coursework
- have completed an intro to object oriented programming course **or** have existing familiarity
- be pursuing a course of study related to computer science or software
- complete the pre-work task
- (for on-campus cohorts) should be currently enrolled in the same college or university selected in their application
- (for the 10-week program) should be currently enrolled in a US college or university

### Device Requirements

- You must have access to a Mac computer (with the latest Mac OS installed) that can download and run [XCode 12](https://developer.apple.com/download/).

### Time Commitment

- **Live session attendance:** Classes meet  once or twice per week for 1-2 hour sessions over the duration of the semester.
  - **NOTE:** Session frequency and duration may vary depending on college.
- **Outside of class time:** Student's should plan to spend 5-10 hours outside of class working on weekly assignments and their final group project.

### Attendance and Coursework Submissions

CodePath courses focus on developing student's habits and skills in order to to be successful in the tech industry. Success in industry goes beyond proficiency in technical domains; The ability to be punctual, meet project deadlines and work effectively in a collaborative team are equally important skills. The following policies around attendance and coursework submissions are meant to encourage professional behavior.

#### Coursework Weighting

All coursework grading and accountability is handled by CodePath. The following table outlines how each coursework section is weighted in calculating a student's final grade. See [Coursework Grading](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/grading_spring_2020) for a breakdown of scores for individual coursework items.

| Weight | Section | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 50%     | App Assignments     | 3 App projects: Flixter, Twitter & Instagram   |
| 50%     | Group Project App Milestones     | Original app design, development and demo     |

#### Bonus points

A student can earn bonus points on an app assignment by completing extra app features beyond that which is indicated as required. Bonus points will only be applied within the given coursework section they are earned and won't increase the impact of a given section beyond it's designated weight. For instance, no amount of bonus points will increase the impact of the *Assignments* section beyond 50% of the final grade.

#### Coursework Submissions

- **All coursework items** are submitted through CodePath Course Portal and due by their posted deadlines.
- **Three (48 hour deadline extensions)** are allowed for the entire semester no questions asked. 
  - This will be automatically triggered as soon as the deadline is missed-- there is no need to request extensions.
  - 48 hours is the maximum allowed extension for any individual coursework item, extensions cannot be combined per coursework item.
- **Once the 3 deadline extensions have been used**, any future late coursework item (submitted after the posted deadline) will not be accepted and the student will receive a 0 for that submission.

#### Attendance

**Allowable absences:**
  
- (Non-credit sites) Max of 3 sessions. 
  - Anything beyond this will result in an automatic withdrawal from the program at that time.
  - Submission of that unit's coursework by the deadline is still mandatory.
- (For-credit sites) Please check with your professor and/or campus policies.

#### Attendance Incentives

- **Perfect Attendance:** Attendance at ALL sessions will result in the addition of 10% points to the final grade. (i.e. a 70% would become an 80% and an 85% would become a 95%)
- **Consistent Attendance:** Attendance at at least 1 session for every week **OR** 70% of all sessions of the course will result in the addition of 5% points to the final grade. (i.e. a 70% would become a 75% and an 85% would become a 90%)

#### CodePath Requirements for Course Completion

CodePath holds all professional and college students to the same high bar of quality coursework and professionalism. In order to be considered CodePath alumni and receive recognition for successful completion of the course from CodePath, **students must complete the course with a final grade of 60% or above**.

Students meeting the above requirements will:

1. Receive a (digital) CodePath certificate of completion.

#### Courses Offered for College Credit

For students taking a CodePath course for credit at their college, the professor of record at the college for which the course is being taken will have full discretion and the final decision for any grades a student receives in the course at their college. Students should defer to their college for specific add/drop, course withdrawal and grading policies.

- CodePath will provide the professor of record with all grades and student data from the course.
- The final grade given to a student at their college is decided by the professor of record for the course and is independent of the final grade determined by CodePath.

### Student Privacy

CodePath adheres to best practices and complies with all regulations regarding student information and data privacy as outlined by FERPA.

- Private student information and assessment data will only be shared with relevant team members within the CodePath organization and the professor of record for the participating college.

### Course Structure

 This courses teaches iOS development in a project-based format over a 15-week period. Each week builds on the skills and knowledge from the previous week:

* **Weekly App Assignment.** A new mobile app is assigned to each student as an individual project.
* **Code Review.** We will briefly review each app and provide feedback on code.
* **Labs.** Students will practice pair-programming while working on app projects during class sessions once a week.
* **Online Support.** Students can post questions and get support through our Discussions System.
* **Github Based Online Learning Portal.** Students will have access to a custom learning portal with videos, code samples, and comprehensive documentation library.

- **In-Person Class Sessions:** Students meet in person twice a week in 2 hour sessions to complete labs, work on weekly assignment project apps and design and implement their final group project. Note: Session frequency and time may vary by college.
- **Assignments:** Each week, we will be building an iOS app that helps us reinforce and apply the concepts we introduce within the course. Expect the weekly apps to take anywhere from 5-10+ hours to complete each week outside of class. These projects will range from a basic movie reviews app to a full-featured Twitter Client.
- **Group Project:** In addition to the apps assigned each week, we will also have a collaborative course-wide project. The class will be broken up into groups of 3 students each, and every group will select a larger project to scope, design and build over the course of the class. At the end of the course, we will do a _demo day_ showcasing all of these projects. Read more about the [[course-wide group project|Group Project]].

### Assignments

Students will build three fully functional app projects over the first 6 weeks of the course. Each app project spans 2 weeks and is broken up into 2 parts, resulting in an app assignment deliverable each week. Weekly app assignments typically require anywhere from 5-10 hours outside of class session times to complete. Weekly app assignments are due by their posted deadlines.
