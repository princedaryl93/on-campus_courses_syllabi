## On-Campus Courses Syllabi

### Course Description
These courses are semester-long project-based explorations into iOS, Android or Cybersecurity of intense, project-focused training inspired by our professional courses and facilitated by CodePath-trained Teaching Assistants. Classes meet on campus once or twice a week for lab and working sessions. In the first half of the course, students develop skills by completing coding labs and building fully functional app assignment projects. In the second half of the course students will apply their skills--working together in small teams--to design and build an original app from the ground up. The course culminates in a Demo Day event where teams will present their finished apps in a live demo.
